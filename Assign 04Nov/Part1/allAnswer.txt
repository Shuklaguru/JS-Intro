Ans1.--  Operator in javaScript perform various operation on variable and values.They are 
           Essential for manipulating data and controlling program flow.


Ans2– there are mainly 5 types of operator in javaScript:
1. Arithmetic operator 
2. Comparison operator 
3. Logical operator
4. Assignment operator
5. Miscellaneous operator




Ans3.  difference between unary , ternary and binary operator are as follows–
1. Unary operator-
* Unary operate on single operands.
* Example include (+,-,!, Typeof).
2. Ternary operator
* Binary operator operate on two operands.
* Example includes arithmetic operator, comparison and logical operator symbol.
3.    Ternary operator
* Ternary operator is only operator in javaScript that take two operator.
* If short hand writing the if-else condition.




Ans3.    Operator Precedence.
* Operator precedence determine the order in which operator are evaluated
* Like multiplication has higher precedence and plus(+) has lower precedence.




         Operator associativity
* Associativity determine a grouping if operator with the same precedence
* left -to - right associativity means the leftmost operands have higher priority.
